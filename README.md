Example and template Python/C++ projects using Pybind11

## cpp_only
Python bindings for a C++ only code-base

## cpp_submodule
C++ library operates as a submodule to a Python library, allowing mixed Python and C++ usage

## hpc_example
An example of the cpp_submodule type project with examples relevant to high performance computing.
It demonstrates computing the dot product of two arrays using:
+ Native Python
+ NumPy + Python
+ Serial C++ 
+ OpenMP parallelization C++
+ MPI parallelization C++
+ GPU CUDA C++

## misc
Miscellaneous examples, including:
+ Interfacing with Eigen Tensors 
+ A 2D grid interpolation to speedup SciPy's RegularGridInterpolator
+ Interfacing with CUDA's FFT library, CUFFT, and comparing performance to NumPy and PyFFTW
